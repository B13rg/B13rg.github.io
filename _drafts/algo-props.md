* Simple - Does only what it needs to
* Performant - 
* Predictable - predictable performance and behavior characteristics _over runtime_
* Correctness - 
* Parallelism/pipelining/serialization - 
* Locality - able to perform operations on subsets of the data
* Preparation vs. work stages - 
* Data shapes - what data shapes are consumed and produced, pre-processing requirements/opportunities?
* Composable - ability to integrate with itself and other tools
* Data Hierarchy - CPU, Memory, disk, network
* Bottleneck/cache/buffer awareness
* Data scale limits
