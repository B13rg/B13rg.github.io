What is an identity on the internet?
How do the various identities interact?

## What is an Identity on the Internet?

Of course, one will have trouble going from a "Facebook 'erry day" user to "anonymous hackerman" in one swoop.
It takes a behavioral change to change how you look at and interact with the internet.
There's useful documents like https://anonymousplanet.org/guide-dark.pdf which can help guide you, but I find I learn best through practice.

I think one mindset shift that helps is caring less about individual accounts.
By viewing accounts as more temporary and "ethereal", it makes it easier to "move on" to new accounts once you feel your footprint with an account is large enough.

Create an "Indentinet", where identies are the endpoints of all communication.

Before we talk about it, we have to define terms and verbage:

Users
Identity
Providers


On most services, in order to take advantage of the full "platform experience", you are required to have some sort of account or identifier as a way to distinctly identify a single user.
This makes sense, as users will have public and private information the service needs to keep track of to provide a good customer experience.
Some providers collect more information than they need to, but at a minimum there is usually a distinct username and a password.

There are some sites that are different, 

All the content and interactions you make on the platform are connected to that identity.
The account identity is not necessarily connected to their real identity, or other online identities the user has.
On many services, you are able to create as many accounts as you want while on others (like Facebook) you are only allowed one.

This single identifier is used to not only connect together content they create (comments, posts, metadata), but to also act as a way for others to engage and interact with a user over time spans longer than a single conversation or interaction.
This allows a user to build "repertoire" and build credibility based on their previous content.
An anonymous comment alone holds little value by itself (see 4chan), but having a history of content creation brings greater credibility to the argument or message being communicated.

The way different sites treat an account effect how users interact with the site.
Users' behavior on 4chan is vastly different than that on Reddit or Facebook, no doubt due to everyone posting psuedo-anonymously.
The lack of identity behind a post or comment allows people to feel more at ease posting edgy or controversial content.

Creates a record of who they are , based on the content they've interacted with.

Contains not just interactions, but when they took place over time.
Allows one to build a profile of who they are and how they've changed over time, at least through the one account.

Day by day, you can build trends about the user, like when they are online, and what sort of actions they take.
You can see how the interests have changed over time, how they as a person have changed over time.

These are all things that are good for other people viewing an account, what benefits does an account bring to the person who owns it?



How important is it to have a single personal identity?

There are different layers of identity

* Physical properties
  * Type of device
  * Device identifiers
  * internet provider
* Software properties
  * cookies
  * accounts
  * logins
  * service identity
  * software identity

"Internet stakeholder intrests"

Identifies 3 groups:
* Users: 
  * identified by devices and software, 
  * "interest in use of services, infrstructure, and properties associated with such use"
  * does not want other to "know" [????]
* Providers:
  * 
  * target is business, through providing use fo services and infrstructure
* Society:
  * 


The paper only analyzes from an economic standpoint, looking at economical value to companies.
Focuses more on the user-provider interaction rather than user-user via provider.

### Ship of Thebes

You are not the same person you were 10 years ago, 1 year ago, 1 month ago, 10 seconds ago.
You change and develop both physically and mentally.

Just like how pictures or don't accurately represent who you are now, things tied to an account might not represent who you are as a person now.
Content created by an account merely show a snapshot of who you are at that single moment.
People change over time, look back on old facebook posts and cringe at what was there.

Account is supposed to represent you as a person on a platform, but slowly there is a disparity created between your account persona and your personal persona.                                                                                                                           
* Is there always a disparity? 
  * Some may be closer or further from the real person, depending on purpose of the account and service.
* Can be intentional or unintentional
  * People control what content they create online, so account may be equivalent to a mindfully crafted persona and is intentionally separate from their actual persona.
  * Plato's cave?  Where the accounts are shadows of the real thing

Account may eventually reach a point where it is far removed from a person's actual persona that it no longer represents who they are as a real-life person, only who they are on that account.

Which is the "source of truth"?
Which persona is a user's "real" persona?
Seems like a simple question, the real-life person is, right?
Depends on the environment and frame of reference.
In the real world, the person themselves is the source of truth.

On the internet, is that still the case?
Unless you know someone in real life, your entire knowledge of a person is based on their online persona.
Therefore, you must base you interactions with people solely on how they portray themselves online, which may or may not be similar to their public and private personas.
Because that's all the data you have access to, you have to base your impression of someone entirely off of their posted content, which makes things more difficult.

### Memory and the Internet

Unlike a real person, internet never forgets.
While a person slowly forgets things as new things are learned, internet does not.
While you may not remember every second of every day, you still experienced it.
In the end, it is the end-result of actions taken that matters, not the actions themselves.

On the internet, both the actions (created content) and end-result (people's interactions with that content) are preserved.
People have old content from their past self that may reflect badly on their current self.
Even if they have developed as a person, their account persona does not.

Eventually people may reach a point where the account has diverged so much from who they actually are it is better to start over from scratch instead of continue with their current account.

To make things more like our mind, the internet "auto-forget" things after a period of time.
It wouldn't necessarily be fully deleted, but at least made more difficult to get to (to "remember").

Example: Internet Archive

If you go to a website, you see the website as it is in the moment.
Different parts of the website may have been added at different times, but what you see is the combination of all that into a single website "in the now".

Next time you go to the website, it may be the same or different than what you saw before.
The owner might have added new sections, removed old ones, updated color schemes, whatever.
It is still the same website, but content may have been newly created or "forgotten".
What you see when you navigate to the website is the current "persona", with older changes that were removed forgotten, at least from the website.

The internet archive allows one to see all the older versions, and go step by step through the history of the website to see the different changes that took place.
In order view these differences, one has to take the extra steps to pull up the site history.
What if something similar was done with accounts? 
* (Based on the premise of never wanting anything deleted)
  * Should things be deleted?

Accounts "autoprune" old content into an archive that is separate from their actual account.
Content is pruned on a schedule based on the root content, not the content itself (on the post, not comments on the post).
Allows us to treat user's content similar to memory, and have layers of accessability.
Easiest is the "current view", which behaves the same as it does now.
Have graduated "historical" views, which is platform content that is separated based on specific dates or events.
To use, you have to specifically target the "historical" views of things.

Still have a "Bedrock" memory, which contains all content ever created, but as we build layers over time make the stuff at the bottom more difficult to find, such as a separate search index.

Should this be a goal? (Giving the internet memory and the power to "forget")

The digital world is inherently a different medium than the real world, so why should it posses the same restraints as reality?

Is memory and the ability to forget a bug or a feature?
