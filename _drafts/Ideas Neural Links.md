## What ever does the brain control?

Whatever the brain controls we could potentially control or at least monitor with an advanced enough neural link.

Fully Mental:

* Emotions/feelings
* Thoughts/memories
* Motor functions
* Critical thinking

Input from the body:

* Vision
* Hearing
* Feeling/Pain
* Taste
* Smell



Able to communicate between the digital medium and the "thought" [brain, cousiness, cellular, braincell] medium.
Convert information between digitial for "classical" computing and a format that is able to recognized and used by the brain

Generally enhance senses, provide additional or enhanced information.


Easy example: Eyesight Hud
Provide an overlay over vision to enhance, provide additional info.
It will start simple, like the first forays into the window-mouse-desktop interface.
Provide a way (one of many?) to interact or at least monitor all the other things the neural link can do.

Will eventually have external communication or integration.
Able to download, upload, offload work, save data from the neural link.

## Capabilities

In this post, I consider two types of neural links:

* Read
* Read/Write

Just like digital technology, it is easier to simply read data than write and read.
In order to be able to "write" to the brain, we need to understand how to read information from it.

We already are able to read limited amounts of information from the brain through various methods.
It's enough that we are able to 

### Read-Only Link

Reading information from the brain is much easier than writing it.
You only need to be able to monitor neurons and make sense of the readings.
Reading can be effective even when only a small amount of neurons are monitored.
If a device was able to monitor entire areas at once, we would get exponentially more information.

As the amount of neurons we can monitor at once expands, we'll have a bigger picture of what is going on in the brain.
Reading allows us to extract information about the state of the brain and what it is thinking in the moment.

It could enable one to determine what a person is thinking/feeling
A person cloud keep tabs on themselves and monitor their mental outlook over time.
It would be much easier for a therapist to help a patient if they can more directly understand what a person thinking and feeling.
This would make them a true "outside observer" that can provide more thorough and specific guidance when the patient is processing thoughts.

"Personal dashboard" app that shows how your body and mind are feeling at the moment.
Would be like the sims, where different properties of the person are represented as 0-100 bars.
More easily monitor and provide wellness for themselves.
Makes it easier to be self aware and to create clearer signals for what a body or person needs

Mesh with computers more easily.
Instead of needing to interface with a computer through a keyboard/mouse/screen, can read intentions directly to the brain, resulting in easier adoption of computers and ability to more quickly use computers.

With medical patients, could more closely monitor vitals through the brain, and be aware of things like pain, hunger, dehydration etc.

### Read-Write Link

Writing allows us to write information to the brain.

Two way communication
Allow us to communicate directly brain-to-brain, instead of needing to use an intermediate medium like speech (Brain thoughts -> words -> voice -> hearing -> brain) or writing (Brain thoughts -> words -> reading -> brain).
Without needing to convert abstract ideas to formal language, we could more easily share ideas.
Still may be issues because of how people think about things differently...

control emotions/health/physical properties
When you feel tired int he morning, press a button to pep up your brain a little bit.
Could more easily give yourself the drive to go out and do things like exercise or practice
Could put yourself in a "focus" mode, where you have your brain become more focused and remove distractions through things like muting hearing or muting pain/hunger signals (temporarily)

Simulate drugs.  Instead of smoking weed or snorting coke etc, neuralink could simulate the drug in the brain, giving the user the same or similar experience without requiring the drug.  Paired with brain "backup/restore", could more safely take drugs with a lesser risk of damaging the brain.

Create brain backup + restore.
May be a little difficult because the brain is a physical set of neurons, but given enough technology we could "re-wire" the brain to a state that was recorded previously.
Could be used to 

## Uses outside the individual


Monitoring a patient or set of patients, in addition to normal monitoring.
For certain types of patients, it would be useful do have a way to directly monitor the brain.
Assist in healing neural degenerative diseases, like alzheimers and Dementia.
Allow people to just be generally smarter, and can heal or at least recover from damage caused by smoking, drug use, or injuries.
Enable doctors, psychiatrist to better understanding the thoughts and feelings a person is experiencing.

Better communication between people.
More clearly communicate thoughts and feelings.

New types of societies, groups wheres everyone's thoughts are shared.
Group meditation
True "group think", where you thoughts blend with everyone elses.

Form groups like the weazles _A Fire Upon the Deep_.


Use the brain as a processor
Use the brain to process information, either for themselves or for a company
Innstead of working an 8 hour day, part of your brain plays in a virtual world while the other part is "rented out" by companies for use as a 

Control the body, similar to the sims.
Experience all the same feelings.
Trade bodies with people.
"Real Life Sims"....   Reals?
More perfect form for sports
Trade bodies romantically.

Twitch Streams where you experience everything the streamer experiences.
True IRL tv.

Education, where we teach things by sharing thoughts around a subject.
Eduction is about learning about individual things, and how they are connect/inter-related to other things

## Chances for mis-use / abuse

DDOS heart attack
co-opt / take over
rent out brain for work


## General Concerns, mis-use and abuse

The capability to interact so closely with a person's brain can be used for both good and evil.
There are many privacy and safety concerns.
A neural link would be just as vulnerable to attack as a normal computer, with the added risk of having it interface directly with the brain.

Viruses that target the neural link or brain

Hardware link only for security, a-la ghost in the shell.
Potential for abuse over wireless communication is just too great, at least for the time being.
We may eventually have a wireless link to the computers around us, but I think it should come once the technology becomes more "normal".

Hold memories for ransom with "Bitlocker" mind virus.
Exfiltrate or steal information
Thoughts, memories, passwords, plans.

Used for literal mind reading and modification.
Give oneself over to an authority, which is able to completely control their mind.
Form of labor, some sort of perverted revival of slavery/imprisonment.
People sell control of their bodies for period of time

No longer able to have private thoughts.

Could be used this way by cults, governments, companies, on a wide scale.
Could also be marketed toward parents, so they can more closely monitor their children.

Needs some sort of hardware switch that is controllable by the user
In the beginning, integrate next to the brain, giving the link limited capabilities for control, but also performance.
Later integrate deeper and deeper into the brain, hopefully learn lessons about security and privacy early on, so these can be implemented more safety, with less risk of damage to the user through the actions of a third party.

If it's able to always wirelessly communicate, could end up like the warning on some electronics, about how the device must receive any signal directed at it, and may output other unusual signals (look it up)

Like a cell phone, except more deeply integrated with ourselves.
There are a lot of issues already with cellphones and the types of behaviors the devices and applications that run on them exhibit, especially around privacy and security.
With it interfacing directly with the brain, there is much greater risk to the user.

Not only are there the usual risks around applications and their data, but catastrophic failure can have a huge effect on a person.
It could damage them physically, like if it exploded, shifted unexpectedly(if it's big enough), overheated,  physically effected the brain.
It could also damage you mentally, removing senses, creating pain, hallucinations, and other terrible things.

These devices will be extremely powerful, and spiderman responsibilityV.
It will test many levels of people, from single individuals to families, governments to humanity as a whole.
This is a potential next step for humanity, one that not all may take.
It will probably be a spectrum of integration, with some people opting for a small implant of sorts with limited capabilities to entire brain+body enhancements and improvements.



## Potential Uses and Moral Conundrums



## Just the Beginning

These are all questions that each person will need to consider as the technology is developed and begins to be more widely available.

Just like how communication evolved with the creation of writing, the printing press, telephone and internet.

Neural link will create a huge turning point in human history.

Large growing pains once the technology is available.

Just like how computer accelerated technological growth, this will increase it even more.
