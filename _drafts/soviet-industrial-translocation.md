“Operation Barbarossa” was an invasion executed by the Nazi Germany June-December 1941.
Its purpose was to exterminate the slavic people and repopulate it under “Generalplan Ost”.
The operation caught the Soviet Union grossly unaware, and quickly thrust the republic into a fight for survival.

## Definitions

* `Zavod` - "plant" or "factory"
* `-grad-` - 
* `-sky`

## Government Policy, Organization and Planning

State of Industrial resources and planning before

1930s contingency plans

Leading up to the invasion: 
    • State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41)
    • Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41)

### Evacuation council - 24 June 1941 - committee creation

* Committee for Evacuation
* Civilian Evacuation Committee
* Evacuation Council
* The Civilian Evacuation
* Evacuation Commission

Purpose of each council.

### Public and private decrees from Stalin and GKO - Lieberman

Main Director: Deputy Chairman of the USSR SNK and the Chairman of the USSR Gosplan, N.A. Voznesenskiy.

### Communication of Evacuation

effectiveness

Organization of communication and commissions/councils
Cooperation between military, government and localities.
How commands are issued and shared
Implementation of proposed policies
Amount of success and failure in communications




## Geographic Diversification of Production 

Economic Resilience Through Spatial Spread: By relocating factories to Siberia, Central Asia, and the Urals (regions rich in resources like oil, coal, and metals), the USSR avoided over-concentration of production in vulnerable areas.
This diversification allowed continued output even as German forces advanced westward.

Primary areas:
* Ukraine - moved south/southeast
* Donets Basin (Donbass)- moved south/southeast
* Moscow - prepped for siege and assault
* Leningrad - prepped for siege and assault

Weather

## Railway Network as a Critical Strategic Asset

Railway resource leading up to and during.
Railway management, engine types, track types, upkeep.

Required massive amounts of coordination, including temporary rail line expansions, prioritization of freight routes, and the use of "mobile workshops" to repair equipment en route.

Scale of evacuation

Committee for Unloading Transit Freight
Purpose, adopted measures

Management of railroads and dependent resources


## Scale of Evacuation Logistics and Resources

Evacuation Priorities

Resources moved:

* finished goods, wip
* machine tools, power plants/generators
* any remaining (raw) materials

Moving priorities by industry

Further towards rear mean more important.


### Defense Industry

  * Factories
  * Tank + Tank Engine Enterprises
  * Metallurgical
  * Machine Tooling
  * important 

### Agricultural Industry

  * Products
  * Livestock

### Scientific Industry

### Worker/Population Mobilization

In the years leading up to WWII, there was already significant amount of population movement and management.
The late 1920s an idealogical rise of "resettlement as a means of mitigating agrarian overpopulation in the European part of the country" [^Moiseenko].


Most it was manifested in the course of an acute ideological struggle at the end of 20-ies regarding the role of resettlement as a means of mitigation agrarian overpopulation in the European part of the country, as well as labors State Colonization Institute, closed in 1930


By the end of the 1930s, planning and regulation of population movement was managed by state institutions under 


At the time the concept of "population migration" was not commonly used in Soviet publications.
It was instead replaced by "territorial redistribution of population",  the party line of migration as a fundamental redistribution of labor.

#### Passports and Population 

On the eve of 1933 the Central Executive Committee of the USSR established a "Unified Passport System"[^USSR-1].

The passports contained information about the identity of citizens 16 and older, and was required for all persons residing in areas where the passport system was introduced.
Those under 16 were listed as dependents on their caretakers documents.
The passport contained extensive information about the owner, including Name, time/location of birth, nationality, social status, military service status, residence, and place of work.
They were issued for a 3-year term.

In context of population labor organization, it was used as way to more closely manage and monitor population statistics.
It was an alternate population data source to the census, which occurred infrequently in 1920, 1926, (1932 trial), 1937, and 1939.
They never seemed to be particularly organized or accurate, with "the results of the 1937 census showed a completely unsatisfactory arrangement of the current population records."[^Moiseenko].
Without modern tools like computers, it was difficult for the census to capture an accurate and complete snapshot of population.
the passports provided authorities a "live" and somewhat more accurate perspective of population distribution.

At the time the majority of the Soviet population lived in rural areas, and lessons from the census showed how difficult the  low population density made the process.
The rollout this "modern" passport began in larger urban areas, where there were greater concentrations of people.
Based on the city and density, different radii were defined for where passports were required.
Upon arriving in one of these localities the law required the passport be presented to "house management" for verification and approval.

This "accounting of migration" during the collectivization initiative meant that much of the systems and "mentality" required to undergo such a change were already ingrained in the cultural psyche of the soviet people.

#### Populations related to the Factories

the people moved along with the factories roughly fit into three groups:

* Trained factory workers
* Families
* Refugees

## The Moving Process (Follow a Factory)

Kirovsky Zafact or Kirov Plant has a long history in Russia.
It was originally 

Plant that created the KV tank

Combined with other factories in Chelyabinsk. 

Perspective from factory owner and below.

Initial communication and plan

### Disassembly

What is disassembled by whom
How long it takes


### Transportation

How and where it was transported

Rail-focused preparation and requirements

Alternative transport (road, boat?)

"Mobile Workshops" and working conditions

### Re-assembly

Part of existing town

Absorbed into existing plant

New factory towns

Building new facilities for machinery

### Performance

Production ability of factories before and after
Ability to service Soviet war machine.

## Issues Faced

### Insufficient Railroad Transport

re-organization process

### Insufficient time

prioritization of industry and resources

### Labor Shortages

reduction of working age from 16 to 14 (still 6 hour limit)
proportion of youth to adults before and after

reduction of skilled labor

### Insufficient Supplies

Food
Making up for resource losses to invaders

### Finished Good Complexity

Changes to model designs due to complexity and resource availability

abandon or modify designs that were difficult to produce or require imported minerals
Use locally available resources and materials.

Examples:

76-mm cannon - 
  * 1936: 2,080 parts
  * 1939: 1,057 parts
  * 1942: 719 parts (ZIS-3)

## Impact on Post-War Industrial Strategy 

Legacy for Economic Planning: The success of the relocation led to long-term investments in Siberian and Central Asian infrastructure post-war, positioning these regions as key economic hubs.
This foreshadowed the Soviet Union’s reliance on resource-rich remote areas for industrial growth.

Industrial capacity, mobility and logistics vs. territorial control.

5 years, 50 years, now

## Limits to analysis

Many sources are in russian or are not publicly available.
Much of the foundational data and history population demographics is based on was released in the late 1980s and early 1990s as part of Glasnost policy.
Many documents remain unpublished and are under the control of organizations like the Russian State Archive of Economics, Russian State Archive of Social and Political History, and Central State Historical Archive of the Russian Federation.

Many terms and phrases are translated from russian, and often lose much of the cultural context around words and phrases.

Statistical census data: mis-reported or mis-represent reality.
Things weren't exactly going well famine-wise, so there was definitely a reason to

Introduction of the ordinance:

> In order to better account for the population of cities, workers' settlements and new buildings and the unloading of these settlements from persons not related to the production and work in institutions or schools and not engaged in socially useful work (with the exception of disabled persons and pensioners), as well as in order to clean these settlements from hiding kulak, criminal and other antisocial elements, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR decide: <ordinances>

The ordinance specifically targets "hiding kulak", a term reflecting their status as class enemies of the Committee.

The noun Kulak (or Кула́к) stems from pre-revolutionary Russia, where it was used to describe peasants that owned land and engaged in personal enterprise.
In May 1929 the USSR formally defined "kulak household" (кулацкое хозяйство) as part of "On the characteristics of kulak farms subject to the Labor Code" resolution.
The criteria included:

* Use of permanent hired labor
* Ownership of a mill, a creamery (маслобойня, 'butter-making rig'), other processing equipment, or a complex machine with a motor.
* Systematic renting out of agricultural facilities/equipment.
* Involvement in trade, money-lending, commercial brokerage, or "other sources of non-labor income"

This effectively encompassed any form of personal enterprise.
The decree was made in the midst of collectivization in the USSR, which aimed to transfer private peasant farms and property into state-controlled collective enterprises.

КИРОВСКИЙ ЗАВОД наркомата танковой промышленности

КИРОВСКИЙ ЗАВОД наркомата танковой промышленности. За год до нач. Вел. Отеч. войны Политбюро ЦК ВКП(б) приняло решение об организации на ЧТЗпр-ва танков: уже в кон. 1940 здесь были собраны первые КВ. Война заставила эвакуировать из зап. областей страны большинство пром. предпр. Родств. и смежные заводы – Харьковский моторный и Ленингр. Кировский – были передислоциро-ваны в Чел. Здесь, т. о., было размещено мощ-ное предпр. по пр-ву танков. В связи с этим 6 окт. 1941 ЧТЗ был переименован в К. з. Коллективу завода удалось внедрить единую технологию массового поточного пр-ва и организовать крупносерийный выпуск танков. 7 нояб. 1941 чел. танки приняли участие в параде на Красной пл. и в боях под Москвой прошли первое испытание. За годы войны К. з. дал фронту 18 тыс. танков и самоходных артиллерийских установок (САУ), 48,5 тыс. танк. моторов, 85 тыс. комплектов топливной аппаратуры. Уже в авг. 1942 на заводе наряду с танками КВ выпускались Т-34. В февр. 1943 началось пр-во САУ, а в сент. того же года заработал конвейер по сборке тяжелого танка ИС (танк модификации ИС-3 обладал труднопробиваемой броней). Усовершенствованные нем. танки, появившиеся на фронте в 1944, так и не смогли конкурировать с сов. бронемашинами. Урал. разработчики танков под рук-вом Ж. Я. Котина (Н. Л. Духов, Л. С. Троянов, М. Ф. Балжи, А. И. Ермолаев, И. Я. Трашутин, Я. Е. Вихман и др.) дали фронту 13 типов боевых машин, в т. ч. артиллерийский самоход КВ-7, огнеметный танк КВ-8, тягач ССС-2Т. В 1945 КБ Танкограда было награждено орд. Ленина. На К. з. в Чел. впервые в отеч. танкостроении был применен метод термич. обработки деталей токами высокой частоты; впервые в мировой практике здесь стали отливать крупные стальные детали в металлич. формах вместо песочных. В короткий срок танкостроители освоили автоматич. электросварку по методу акад. Е. О. Патона. Завод 33 раза завоевывал 1-е место и переходящее Кр. знамя ГКО во Всесоюз. социалист. соревновании. За выдающиеся за­слуги в организации пр-ва и освоении новых типов танков, САУ и танк. дизелей завод в авг. 1944 был награжд. орд. Кр. Звезды. Труд челябинцев в годы войны отмечен также орд. Кутузова 1-й степ. 1 июня 1983 за заслуги в Вел. Отеч. войне и в пр-ве для нар. х-ва мощных гусеничных тракторов коллективу ЧТЗ был вручен орд. Труд. Кр. Знамени.

KIROV PLANT of the People's Commissariat of Tank Industry

KIROV PLANT of the People's Commissariat of Tank Industry. A year before the start of the Great Patriotic War, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) decided to organize tank production at ChTZ: already at the end of 1940, the first KV tanks were assembled here. The war forced the evacuation of most industrial enterprises from the western regions of the country. Related and adjacent plants - the Kharkov Motor Plant and the Leningrad Kirov Plant - were relocated to Chelyabinsk. Here, therefore, a powerful tank production enterprise was located. In connection with this, on October 6, 1941, ChTZ was renamed K.Z. The plant's team managed to introduce a unified technology for mass flow production and organize large-scale production of tanks. On November 7, 1941, people The tanks took part in the parade on Red Square and underwent their first test in the battles near Moscow. During the war, K.Z. gave the front 18 thousand tanks and self-propelled artillery units (SPG), 48.5 thousand tank engines, 85 thousand sets of fuel equipment. Already in August 1942, the plant produced T-34 tanks along with KV tanks. In February 1943, production of SPGs began, and in September of the same year, the conveyor for assembling the IS heavy tank began to operate (the IS-3 modification tank had hard-to-penetrate armor). The improved German tanks that appeared on the front in 1944 were never able to compete with the Soviet armored vehicles. Ural. Tank developers under the leadership of Zh. Ya. Kotin (N. L. Dukhov, L. S. Troyanov, M. F. Balzhi, A. I. Ermolaev, I. Ya. Trashutin, Ya. E. Vikhman and others) gave the front 13 types of combat vehicles, including the KV-7 self-propelled artillery piece, the KV-8 flamethrower tank, and the SSS-2T tractor. In 1945, the Tankograd design bureau was awarded the Order of Lenin. At the KZ in Chelyabinsk, for the first time in domestic tank building, the method of heat treatment of parts with high-frequency currents was used; for the first time in world practice, large steel parts were cast here in metal molds instead of sand ones. In a short time, tank builders mastered automatic electric welding using the method of Academician E. O. Paton. The plant won 1st place 33 times and the transferable Krasnodar Territory. GKO banner in the All-Union socialist competition. For outstanding achievements in organizing the production and development of new types of tanks, self-propelled guns and tank diesels, the plant was awarded the Order of the Red Star in August 1944. The work of Chelyabinsk residents during the war was also recognized with the Order of Kutuzov, 1st degree. On June 1, 1983, for services in the Great Patriotic War and in the production of powerful tracked tractors for the people's economy, the ChTZ team was awarded the Order of Labor Red Banner.
