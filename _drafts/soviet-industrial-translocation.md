“Operation Barbarossa” was an invasion executed by the Nazi Germany June 22 - December 5 1941.
Its purpose was to exterminate the slavic people and repopulate it under “Generalplan Ost”.
The operation caught the Soviet Union grossly unaware, and quickly thrust the republic into a fight for survival.

Cooperation between military, government and localities.
How commands are issued and shared
Implementation of proposed policies
Amount of success and failure in communications




## Geographic Diversification of Production 

Most of the existing industrial capacity was centralized in the Donbass/Ukraine regions.


Economic Resilience Through Spatial Spread: By relocating factories to Siberia, Central Asia, and the Urals (regions rich in resources like oil, coal, and metals), the USSR avoided over-concentration of production in vulnerable areas.
This diversification allowed continued output even as German forces advanced westward.

Primary areas:
| Idx | Regions               | Industries | Invasion Response             |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1   | Ukraine                |            | moved south/southeast         |
| 2   | Donets Basin (Donbass) |            | moved south/southeast         |
| 3   | Moscow                 |            | prepped for siege and assault |
| 4   | Leningrad              |            | prepped for siege and assault |

Donets Basin, also known as the Donbass.
Primary source of Soviet coal mining and several industrial centres:

* Dnepropetrovsk - iron and steel
* Stalino - iron and steel
* Kharkov - iron, steel and engineering

## Railway Network as a Critical Strategic Asset

Railway resource leading up to and during.
Railway management, engine types, track types, upkeep.
The first railway was built in Russia in 1837, as a 17km experimental line connecting St. Petersburg and  Tsarskoye Selo.
The "modern" railway network was formed around the St. Petersburg-Moscow railway in 1842 [^RHaywood].
The railway was standardized on 5 ft (1,524 mm) / 1520mm broad gauge.
This is not to say no other gauges existed; railway lines connecting the Russian Empire to it's Prussian and Austrian neighbors would often be in gauges local to those destinations.

As a result of it's development independent of central Europe, engines and cars were incompatible between the two systems.
Much of Europe ended up standardizing on Stephenson gauge, 1,435 mm (4ft 8.5 in) by around 1849.

When the invasion began, a military rail schedule was quickly instituted.
It prioritized transport of military troops and cargo,
To increase throughput, trains were ran also closer together on the track, 

Train engineers and crew would also travel with the trains to their final destination, often thousands of kilometers and many months from home.
This differs from peacetime, where crew would usually work local sections of track.  


Required massive amounts of coordination, including temporary rail line expansions, prioritization of freight routes, and the use of "mobile workshops" to repair equipment en route.

### Scientific Industry

## Worker/Population Mobilization

In the years leading up to WWII, there was already significant amount of population movement and management.

1922-1928 saw the New Economic Policy (NEP) redefine the economic policy structure of the soviet union.
It fostered a mixed economy that allowed small-scale private enterprise.
It promoted labor and trade unions to pool labor and to represent the interests of workers.
Unfortunately, the unions were incorporated as agents of state economic policy and provided a facade of supporting member interests over those of the state.

The late 1920s an ideological rise of "resettlement as a means of mitigating agrarian overpopulation in the European part of the country" [^Moiseenko].
In 1928 a drastic change was made to Soviet economic policy: the "Great Break" (Russian: Великий перелом).
This discarded the NEP for greater focus on collectivization of agriculture and industry under the state.
The trade unions, which had only offered token opposition to the will and interests of the state [^Filtzer].

By the end of the 1930s, planning and regulation of population movement was managed by state institutions under 
The collectivization concentrated the workforce in industrial centers, to the detriment of foundational agricultural enterprises.
Much of the collectivist policy was manifested over the course of an acute ideological struggle at the end of 20-ies regarding the role of resettlement as a means of mitigating agrarian overpopulation in the European part of the country.
By integrating large peasant populations into industrial areas, the social composition of the workforce changed significantly.
"From being an old, experienced working class with log traditions of struggle and organization it became a predominantly young, peasant-based, and unskilled workforce with little proletarian cultural tradition" [^Filtzer].
This resulted in a fractured working class that lacked cohesion and solidarity.

With industrial complexity came the need for skilled workers and middle management.
Those promoted were more sympathetic towards the Stalinist elite.
This new, industrial working class was still ruthlessly exploited.



At the time the concept of "population migration" was not commonly used in Soviet publications.
It was instead replaced by "territorial redistribution of population",  the party line of migration as a fundamental redistribution of labor.

### Passports and Population 

On the eve of 1933 the Central Executive Committee of the USSR established a "Unified Passport System"[^USSR-1].

The passports contained information about the identity of citizens 16 and older, and was required for all persons residing in areas where the passport system was introduced.
Those under 16 were listed as dependents on their caretakers documents.
The passport contained extensive information about the owner, including Name, time/location of birth, nationality, social status, military service status, residence, and place of work.
They were issued for a 3-year term.

In context of population labor organization, it was used as way to more closely manage and monitor population statistics.
It was an alternate population data source to the census, which occurred infrequently in 1920, 1926, (1932 trial), 1937, and 1939.
They never seemed to be particularly organized or accurate, with "the results of the 1937 census showed a completely unsatisfactory arrangement of the current population records."[^Moiseenko].
Without modern tools like computers, it was difficult for the census to capture an accurate and complete snapshot of population.
the passports provided authorities a "live" and somewhat more accurate perspective of population distribution.

At the time the majority of the Soviet population lived in rural areas, and lessons from the census showed how difficult the  low population density made the process.
The rollout this "modern" passport began in larger urban areas, where there were greater concentrations of people.
Based on the city and density, different radii were defined for where passports were required.
Upon arriving in one of these localities the law required the passport be presented to "house management" for verification and approval.

This "accounting of migration" during the collectivization initiative meant that much of the systems and "mentality" required to undergo such a change were already ingrained in the cultural psyche of the soviet people.

> Determine how migrations from collectivization impacted the population's ability to migrate factories during WWII

#### Populations related to the Factories

the people moved along with the factories roughly fit into three groups:

* Trained factory workers
* Families
* Refugees

## The Moving Process (Follow a Factory)

Kirovsky Zafact or Kirov Plant has a long history in Russia.
It was originally 

Plant that created the KV tank

Combined with other factories in Chelyabinsk. 

Perspective from factory owner and below.

Initial communication and plan

### Disassembly

Workers and engineers swarmed over their factories, disassembling and transporting machinery and equipment to the nearest railhead where it was loaded into flatcars or boxcars for their journey east [^ABeevor].
What is disassembled by whom
How long it takes


### Transportation

How and where it was transported

Rail-focused preparation and requirements

Alternative transport (road, boat?)

Workers were moved alongside the factories in cars outfitted with beds and stoves.

"Mobile Workshops" and working conditions

### Re-assembly

Part of existing town

Absorbed into existing plant

New factory towns

Building new facilities for machinery

### Performance

Production ability of factories before and after
Ability to service Soviet war machine.

## Issues Faced

### Insufficient Railroad Transport

re-organization process

### Insufficient time

prioritization of industry and resources

### Labor Shortages

reduction of working age from 16 to 14 (still 6 hour limit)
proportion of youth to adults before and after

reduction of skilled labor

[^Filtzer]



### Insufficient Supplies

Food
Making up for resource losses to invaders

### Finished Good Complexity

Changes to model designs due to complexity and resource availability

abandon or modify designs that were difficult to produce or require imported minerals
Use locally available resources and materials.

Examples:

76-mm cannon - 
  * 1936: 2,080 parts
  * 1939: 1,057 parts
  * 1942: 719 parts (ZIS-3)

## Impact on Post-War Industrial Strategy 

Legacy for Economic Planning: The success of the relocation led to long-term investments in Siberian and Central Asian infrastructure post-war, positioning these regions as key economic hubs.
This foreshadowed the Soviet Union’s reliance on resource-rich remote areas for industrial growth.

Industrial capacity, mobility and logistics vs. territorial control.

5 years, 50 years, now

## Limits to analysis

Many sources are in russian or are not publicly available.
Much of the foundational data and history population demographics is based on was released in the late 1980s and early 1990s as part of Glasnost policy.
Many documents remain unpublished and are under the control of organizations like the Russian State Archive of Economics, Russian State Archive of Social and Political History, and Central State Historical Archive of the Russian Federation.

Many terms and phrases are translated from russian, and often lose much of the cultural context around words and phrases.

Statistical census data: mis-reported or mis-represent reality.
The Soviet Government placed an extreme importance on quantification and statistics.
Mark Harrison points out [^MHarrison]:

> Its [Soviet government regime] control of society and the economy rested upon the administrative capacity to allocate resources in physical quantities from the centre. 
> The regime's legitimacy rested upon claims about the level and rate of growth of national output, productivity, and living standards. 
> Not only were figures the stuff of policy, but the practice of statistics was rendered largely subservient to political ends.

### Leningrad Kirovsky Zavod (LKZ - gr. Leningrad)

Known as:

* ЛКЗ (г. Ленинград)
* Treasury Iron Foundry (1801)
* Putilov Factory (1868)
* Red Putilovite Plant (1922)
* Kirov Plant (1934)
* Factory No. 100 (pre-1941)


Also known as the Kirov Plant, it was originally established in 1801 as a cannonball foundry.
A majority of the plant's capacities were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where it was combined to for "Tankograd".
Some capacity remained in Leningrad, where it continued to repair and assemble tanks and other armored vehicles.

Following the war much of the plant was returned from Chelyabinsk and industrial production continued.
It remained the primary location of Soviet tank building, along with production of non-war machinery like tractors.

    Introduction of the ordinance:

      > In order to better account for the population of cities, workers' settlements and new buildings and the unloading of these settlements from persons not related to the production and work in institutions or schools and not engaged in socially useful work (with the exception of disabled persons and pensioners), as well as in order to clean these settlements from hiding kulak, criminal and other antisocial elements, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR decide: <ordinances>
    
    The ordinance specifically targets "hiding kulak", a term reflecting their status as class enemies of the Committee.
    The noun Kulak (or Кула́к) stems from pre-revolutionary Russia, where it was used to describe peasants that owned land and engaged in personal enterprise.
    In May 1929 the USSR formally defined "kulak household" (кулацкое хозяйство) as part of "On the characteristics of kulak farms subject to the Labor Code" resolution.
    The criteria included:

    * Use of permanent hired labor
    * Ownership of a mill, a creamery (маслобойня, 'butter-making rig'), other processing equipment, or a complex machine with a motor.
    * Systematic renting out of agricultural facilities/equipment.
    * Involvement in trade, money-lending, commercial brokerage, or "other sources of non-labor income"

    This effectively encompassed any form of personal enterprise.
    The decree was made in the midst of collectivization in the USSR, which aimed to transfer private peasant farms and property into state-controlled collective enterprises.

    Through their actions the Stalinist elite sought to break down the working class and remove any ability to act cohesively or collectively.
    The demographics of existing industrial workers was flooded with peasants who had little knowledge of industrial life or collective action.
    The harsh working and loving conditions made "the fight for individual survival take precedence over collective protests".


    The rapid industrial expansion increased demand for skilled technicians, industrial managers and low-level supervisory personnel.
    Additional mobility within the bureaucracy provides means within the system for people to improve their class standing rather than resorting to fighting against a rigid system.
    Even so, the potential for upward mobility was a bigger driver than actual promotions; only a small portion (10-15%) of the workforce were promoted.
    The *possibility* of promotion undoubtedly pacified workers, having them focus on how they could rise within the system instead of dismantling it.

    There were many other policies applied to break down the working class, such as:

    * Socialist Competition: "challenges" exchanged by workers of one factory or shop to another.
    * Shock work (udarnichestvo): Workers who "volunteered" to perform extra work on "Communist Saturdays" (subbotniki), of course for bonuses and access to scarce foodstuffs and consumer goods
    * Nationalism: Attempt to motivate workers through "socialist construction" and pride in the Socialist system and their contribution to creating it.
    * Conspiracies: Sow suspicion among the ranks, keeping workers focused on policing each other instead of reflecting on the system. Show trials targeted class enemies and fostered distrust and resentment between social groups.
    * Purges: Removes institutional knowledge that run incongruent to current Stalinist policy.  Benefits younger workers with less experience and tradition.  Also "frees up space" within the bureaucracy for workers to be promoted into.
