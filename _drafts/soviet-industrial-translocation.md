‚ÄúOperation Barbarossa‚Äù was an invasion executed by the Nazi Germany June-December 1941.
Its purpose was to exterminate the slavic people and repopulate it under ‚ÄúGeneralplan Ost‚Äù.
The operation caught the Soviet Union grossly unaware, and quickly thrust the republic into a fight for survival.

## Government Policy, Organization and Planning

State of Industrial resources and planning before

1930s contingency plans

Leading up to the invasion: 
    ‚Ä¢ State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41)
    ‚Ä¢ Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41)

### Evacuation council - 24 June 1941 - committee creation

* Committee for Evacuation
* Civilian Evacuation Committee
* Evacuation Council
* The Civilian Evacuation
* Evacuation Commission

Purpose of each council.

### Public and private decrees from Stalin and GKO - Lieberman

Main Director: Deputy Chairman of the USSR SNK and the Chairman of the USSR Gosplan, N.A. Voznesenskiy.

### Communication of Evacuation

effectiveness

Organization of communication and commissions/councils
Cooperation between military, government and localities.
How commands are issued and shared
Implementation of proposed policies
Amount of success and failure in communications




## Geographic Diversification of Production 

Economic Resilience Through Spatial Spread: By relocating factories to Siberia, Central Asia, and the Urals (regions rich in resources like oil, coal, and metals), the USSR avoided over-concentration of production in vulnerable areas.
This diversification allowed continued output even as German forces advanced westward.

Primary areas:
* Ukraine - moved south/southeast
* Donets Basin (Donbass)- moved south/southeast
* Moscow - prepped for siege and assault
* Leningrad - prepped for siege and assault

Weather

## Railway Network as a Critical Strategic Asset

Railway resource leading up to and during.
Railway management, engine types, track types, upkeep.

Required massive amounts of coordination, including temporary rail line expansions, prioritization of freight routes, and the use of "mobile workshops" to repair equipment en route.

Scale of evacuation

Committee for Unloading Transit Freight
Purpose, adopted measures

Management of railroads and dependent resources


## Scale of Evacuation Logistics and Resources

Evacuation Priorities

Resources moved:

* finished goods, wip
* machine tools, power plants/generators
* any remaining (raw) materials

Moving priorities by industry

Further towards rear mean more important.


### Defense Industry

  * Factories
  * Tank + Tank Engine Enterprises
  * Metallurgical
  * Machine Tooling
  * important 

### Agricultural Industry

  * Products
  * Livestock

### Scientific Industry

### Worker Mobilization

Human aspect.
Movement of people, and all that they require.

Trained factory workers
Families
Refugees

## The Moving Process (Follow a Factory)

Perspective from factory owner and below.

Initial communication and plan

### Disassembly

What is disassembled by whom
How long it takes


### Transportation

How and where it was transported

Rail-focused preparation and requirements

Alternative transport (road, boat?)

"Mobile Workshops" and working conditions

### Re-assembly

Part of existing town

Absorbed into existing plant

New factory towns

Building new facilities for machinery

### Performance

Production ability of factories before and after
Ability to service Soviet war machine.

## Issues Faced

### Insufficient Railroad Transport

re-organization process

### Insufficient time

prioritization of industry and resources

### Labor Shortages

reduction of working age from 16 to 14 (still 6 hour limit)
proportion of youth to adults before and after

reduction of skilled labor

### Insufficient Supplies

Food
Making up for resource losses to invaders

### Finished Good Complexity

Changes to model designs due to complexity and resource availability

abandon or modify designs that were difficult to produce or require imported minerals
Use locally available resources and materials.

Examples:

76-mm cannon - 
  * 1936: 2,080 parts
  * 1939: 1,057 parts
  * 1942: 719 parts (ZIS-3)

## Impact on Post-War Industrial Strategy 

Legacy for Economic Planning: The success of the relocation led to long-term investments in Siberian and Central Asian infrastructure post-war, positioning these regions as key economic hubs.
This foreshadowed the Soviet Union‚Äôs reliance on resource-rich remote areas for industrial growth.

Industrial capacity, mobility and logistics vs. territorial control.
