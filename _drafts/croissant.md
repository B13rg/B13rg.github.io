Intro:

> Datasets are the basis of machine learning (ML). However, a lack of standardization in the description and semantics of ML datasets has made it increasingly difficult for researchers and practitioners to explore, understand, and use all but a small fraction of popular datasets.
> 
> The Croissant metadata format simplifies how data is used by ML models. It provides a vocabulary for dataset attributes, streamlining how data is loaded across ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow or JAX. In doing so, Croissant enables the interchange of datasets between ML frameworks and beyond, tackling a variety of discoverability, portability, reproducibility, and responsible AI (RAI) challenges.

The croissant format roughly consists of 3 parts:

| Type                | Desc.                                                                                 | Objects                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| metadata            | information about the dataset, including description, source, licensing, and keywords | `Dataset`                          |
| resources           | information about the raw files/filesets contained in the dataset                     | `FileObject`, `FileSet`,           |
| structure+semantics | data structure and resource processing guides                                         | `RecordSet`, `Field`, `DataSource` |
