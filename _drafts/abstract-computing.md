### storage

Goals:

* Store data in original format
* Store additional metadata and updates

Flatten application layers where things run locally but delegate to upstream servers to enrich data.
data types:
  * primary: the raw data created by an application, data near the user.
  * secondary: meta-data generated from a single set of primary data
  * tertiary: combination and correlation across primary and secondary data sets

Folder Structure:

```
item
  data
    *.*
  metadata
    generated-index.json
    *.*
```
