### networking

use latency to upstream servers as a memory buffer, similar to delay-line memory
  * [magnetostrictive delay line memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-line_memory)
  * optical delay line in optical computing: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675424


hmmm, what's cheaper, vps memory or network transit?

Two nodes, primary and reflector
maximal latency
UDP


### storage

Goals:

* Store data in original format
* Store additional metadata and updates

Flatten application layers where things run locally but delegate to upstream servers to enrich data.
data types:
  * primary: the raw data created by an application, data near the user.
  * secondary: meta-data generated from a single set of primary data
  * tertiary: combination and correlation across primary and secondary data sets

Folder Structure:

```
item
  data
    *.*
  metadata
    generated-index.json
    *.*
```
