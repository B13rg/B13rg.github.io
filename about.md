![Hey, that's me](/images/profile.jpg)

Hi, my name is Brooke Byers.  At Oregon State Univeristy, I studied Computer Science and History with an emphasis on the Soviet Union.

I have worked at Apptio and IBM as an SRE and network engineer.

I am a programmer who is especially interested in old computers/consoles.
Some of my favorites include:

* Atari 400/800
* Commodore 64
* IBM PC
* Gameboy

In my free time I enjoy sailing, Counter-Strike and playing with my homelab.
