## Projects

### Erasure encoding

Investigate and tested storage encoding, determining performance characteristics of various encoding types.
Improved storage density by moving from 3x triplicate to 5+2 erasure encoding that improved storage efficiency without greatly impacting platform services.

### GTN

Global IPSec mesh network.
Unified 3 clouds, 9 regions, bridged multiple corporate/gov networks.

### AWS IPAM

Manage platform IP allocations centrally, and enable automatic management and deployment of ranges to team cloud accounts.

### PingIdentity

Architected, deployed and managed customer / internal product SSO.
Created an active-active multi-region deployment with automatic failover.
Ensured clean migration and enabled updates with no downtime.

### Netblock registration / management

### kr8+

Open source tool to generate static cluster config from jsonnet.
Allows combining manifests from multiple sources (templates, compose, helm, raw) to idempotent generate files to be consumed by automation.

### C# login auth

Updated legacy auth system built on MD5, applying modern ciphers and practices to password hash management.

### DC Smarthands

Performed smart-hands activities in a variety of datacenters.  Managed physical resources, replaced failed parts, and worked with RMA services.
