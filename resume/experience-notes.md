As part of the platform team at Apptio and IBM, I assisted in maintaining 4 9s of reliability for the Apptio family of Saas products which included customer data ingest and processing.  The platform encompassed most of the resources consumed by services, including networking, storage, compute, monitoring, customer AuthN,  and patching.
My primary focus was the networking aspects of the platform, architecting and managing the Global Transit Network which securely connected 3 cloud providers,  7+ regions, and over 100 accounts.  Over 4 years of managing the network there were less than 4 outages, each less than 15 minutes.


## Security Experience

I graduated Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science with a focus on security.  
While in school, I worked  Kannact as an IT specialist where I setup and managed employee computer resources, including office network, employee laptops, and active directory.

I worked at Apptio for 5 years, where I helped managed our platform security first with physical data centers and later AWS, GCP, Azure and more.  Through that entire time I performed security and analysis operations, including designing, maintaining, and replacing pieces of infrastructure.  A distinct example is the Pinfederate deployment, which managed product catalog authentication against internal and customer identity stores, which I took from a legacy "testing" deployment to a fully CI/CD managed, redundant-region deployment  with monitoring, dashboards, and documentation.

In my 2 years at IBM I continued these duties, with additional exploration into mainframe security.


Beyond platform level experience, I also have extension software engineering skills across a variety of languages.
I have knowledge and experience with of both high-level application security and core cryptography primitives.  I apply the red team mindset to all my work and strive to implement solutions that consider security from the beginning.

Thank you for the consideration!
